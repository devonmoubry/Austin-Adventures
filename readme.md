## What is it?
The Iron Yard Spring 2017 Front End Engineering Cohort final project.
Austin Adventures.
This app allows users to search for outdoor activities and restaurants based on location.
The first phase will include hikes and brunch spots in Austin.

## What does it do?
Anonymous users will be able to search for a hike and see brunch locations "nearby". The map will show an icon at the trailheads and at restaurants. Users will be able to read yelp reviews about the restaurants and choose based on their preferred proximity. Phase 2 will add the trail outline to the map overlay, include other activities like biking, and canoeing/kayaking and additional restaurants beyond brunch offerings. Once users are registered and logged in, they can create a hike or add a restaurant with a form. They can include photos, links, and write yelp reviews in-app. Later hiking features will include sharing map points and directions with friends, filters for kid-friendly, pet-friendly, time to complete hike, and difficulty rating. Later restaurant features will include filtering by cuisine, whether they offer take-out, and connecting to OpenTable to make a reservation.
