    "review": "Some people prefer their brunch to be basic, but they are probably the same folks who made Meghan Trainor a thing. Those of us with more taste or who prefer something a bit more creative appreciate that chef Joe Anguiano has his own take on brunch classics like a potato churro blini topped with smoked Tasmanian trout or a Duroc pork hash swimming in salsa verde. Beverage director JR Mocanu's drinks are equally innovative. Order the Sif's Song, tomato- and caper berry-infused aquavit served with a simple syrup of thyme, sea salt, orange peel, and black pepper."

    "review": "Barely a month old, Sway's Thai-inflected brunch is already drawing crowds. Familiar favorites are completely transformed by chef Martin Wilda's adventurous palate. Chicken and waffles are served with a green nahm jihm and maple-lemon butter, biscuits and gravy uses bacon powder and crispy basil leaf, and a simple mussel omelette gets some spark from sambal. The cocktail menu has a few tricks too, reinventing the mimosa with hibiscus and grapefruit, and turning the michelada into a cucumber tomatillo masterpiece."

The brunch pulls from Texas' culinary heritage – duck confit migas with queso and ranchera salsa; schnitzel with country ham, poached eggs, smoked Gouda gravy, and arugula; and chicken-fried steak and waffles. Don't miss the pastries, like a cranberry-and-pecan scone and the best blueberry bread this side of your grandma's house."

The raw bar is a must, of course, serving a bright hamachi crudo, blue crab, oysters, and more. But there's plenty of surprises, like a sunny grilled Little Gem lettuce salad with white anchovies, or a playful version of angels on horseback with pork rillette, raisin, and pecan crème fraîche."

But we recommend you indulge a little. Pastry chef Amanda Rockman will make you swoon with apple frangipane croissants and crust kouign amanns.

The shrimp and grits are studded with pancetta and butter; an omelette includes fried oysters, bacon, and Parmesan; and the Benedict is served on a potato latke. Don't leave without ordering something from the vast raw bar, featuring everything from Maine lobster to Middleneck clams."

Cozy up with a selection of hot teas, including so-hot-right-now pu-erh, or down one of Wu Chow's takes on the mimosa, with chrysanthemum tea instead of orange juice."

The frittata gets zip from a tomato emulsion, and Meyer lemon and goat feta make roasted trumpet mushrooms uncommonly bright. And for our money, the whipped Dijon used with grilled fingerling potatoes has more sex appeal than Marcello Mastroianni. Don't skip out on pastry chef Kirsten Bellah's pastries (the honey-dipped doughnut holes are bellissima) or the Giancarlo, No!, a refreshing reviver of gin, Aperol, grapefruit, and soda."

In addition to the Chicken N Waffles and the Lumberjack Hash, the brunch menu reimagines breakfast classics with dishes like the Burnet Benedict, which layers a jalapeño cornbread muffin with sausage, poached egg, and habanero Hollandaise, and the '42 Omelet, bursting with seasonal veggies, smoked Gouda, pumpernickel, and Sriracha yogurt. - A.T."

Full espresso bar and cocktail service are definite pluses, but the real draw is the food. Reliably well-executed dishes including croque madame, brisket ravioli, chicken tagine pot pie, steak and eggs, pain perdu, and French onion tart have earned Cafe Malta a following, and the prices are surprisingly low, ranging from $6-11. - K.T."

Hungry vegetarians will want to try the Flautas de Papa ($11), potato enchiladas that manage to be both light and filling; carnivores will love the Lomo de Res ($16), an upscale version of steak and eggs. Drink specials include $5 Mexican mimosas (orange juice, sparkling wine, and a splash of Bauchant orange liqueur) and serrano chile-spiked Bloody Marias.
