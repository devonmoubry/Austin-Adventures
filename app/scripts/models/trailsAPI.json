This park is mainly a traditional neighborhood park. It has barbeque pits, basketball courts, multipurpose fields, picnic shelters, and a playground. Although its main purpose serves as a place for recreation fields and picnic areas it does have a 1 mile trail.<br /><br />The 1 mile trail loops around half of the park and looks out upon open fields. It's the perfect place to get out and stretch your legs a little.","length":0.0,"activity_type":{"created_at":"2012-08-15T16:12:21Z","id":2,"name":"hiking","updated_at":"2012-08-15T16:12:21Z"},"thumbnail":null,"rank":null,"rating":0.0}]},{"city":"Austin","state":"Texas","country":"United States","name":"Schroeter Park","parent_id":null,"unique_id":22284,"directions":"11701 Big Trail, 78759","lat":30.414445,"lon":-97.737815,"description":"Schroeter features a large wildflower area in the spring.
